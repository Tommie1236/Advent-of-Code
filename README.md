# Advent-of-Code
My solutions and writeup of the [AoC challenges](https://adventofcode.com/).
I can release the writeups the day after the challenge. It is [not allowed](https://adventofcode.com/2015/about) to publish answers/writeups on the day of the challenge to not influence the global leaderboard.

I use a file called `input.txt` to store the input data. but you can't share your input so that file isn't included in the repo. If you use my code you need to add the `input.txt` file yourself.
